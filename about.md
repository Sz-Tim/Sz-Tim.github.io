I'm a quantitative ecologist interested in understanding patterns of species distributions and diversity across spatial scales. My work often involves modeling and simulation-based approaches, both in empirical and theoretical contexts. I'm currently focused on distribution models of invasive plant species, but I've worked with insects and mammals in the past as well. You can find more about my academic research on my [research](link) page. I am passionate about education and believe firmly in the value of a broadly educated populace. See more about my teaching experience and philosophy on my [teaching](link) page.
