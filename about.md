I'm a quantitative ecologist interested in understanding patterns of species distributions and diversity across spatial scales. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of New Hampshire focusing on methods for predicting species distributions. My work often involves modeling and simulation-based approaches, both in empirical and theoretical contexts. My current research is on invasive plant species, but I've worked with insects and mammals in the past as well. You can find more about my academic research on my [research](research.md) and [publications](publications.md) pages. I am passionate about education and believe firmly in the value of a broadly educated populace. See more about my teaching experience and philosophy on my [teaching](teaching.md) page. Right now, I'm living in Aspen, CO where I spend my free time biking, hiking, skiing, and generally spending as much time as possible in the mountains.
