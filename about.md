I'm a quantitative ecologist interested in understanding patterns of species distributions and diversity across spatial scales. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Lausanne focusing on methods for integrating citizen science collections with structured samples to understand the patterns and drivers of species diversity. My work often involves modeling and simulation-based approaches, both in empirical and theoretical contexts. My current research is on ant species, but I've worked with plants, other insects, and mammals in the past as well. You can find more about my academic research on my [research](research.md) and [publications](publications.md) pages. I am passionate about education and believe firmly in the value of a broadly educated populace. See more about my teaching experience and philosophy on my [teaching](teaching.md) page. Right now, I'm living in Lausanne, Switzerland where I spend my free time biking, hiking, skiing, and visiting new places.
