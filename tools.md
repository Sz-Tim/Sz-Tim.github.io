### Tools  
<img width="275" height="300" style="float:right; margin: 0px 20px" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/COVID_Italy.png">[COVID-19 Data Trends Explorer](https://sz-tim.shinyapps.io/covid19-ihme/)    
An interactive [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) app that allows you to explore the trends of the COVID-19 pandemic within or among countries and US states, visually assess the accuracy of models predicting the progression, and keep track of when, where, and whether peaks in cases or mortality are occurring. Developed as a more formal, user-friendly extension of my own personal morbid curiosity every morning. All code is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sz-Tim/COVID19-IHME).  


### Tutorials

A three-part youtube tutorial on a better way of keeping track of your files. Includes an overview of how git works, instructions for setting up git with RStudio, and a demonstration of how to use them together. Originally a component of the UNH course *Data Manipulation and Modelling in R*. All code and instructions are published on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sz-Tim/NR995_Module_9).  

[Introduction to Bayesian models in Stan]({{ site.url }}/assets/stan_intro.pdf)  
A very brief, practical introduction to Bayesian models, with some particularities of how the syntax and data structures in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org//) differ from those in [R](http://cran.r-project.org/). Slides only.
