### Tools  
[COVID-19 Data Trends Explorer](https://sz-tim.shinyapps.io/covid19-ihme/)    
[<img width="250" height="275" style="float:right; margin-left: 10px" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/COVID_Italy.png">](https://sz-tim.shinyapps.io/covid19-ihme/)An interactive website that allows you to explore the trends of the COVID-19 pandemic within or among countries or US states, visually assess the accuracy of models predicting the progression, and keep track of when, where, and whether peaks in cases or mortality are occurring. The predictive models come from the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](http://www.healthdata.org/covid), which are widely used by governmental agencies in the United States. The case and mortality numbers are automatically updated every day from the [Johns Hopkins](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) dataset. The tool was built in R using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). All code is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sz-Tim/COVID19-IHME).  


[Climate across lifetimes](https://sz-tim.shinyapps.io/climate-in-my-life/)  
Ever wonder how the Earth's climate during your lifetime compares to that of your parents or grandparents? This small webtool lets you explore the range of global averages experienced during two people's lives. The tool was built in R using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). All code is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sz-Tim/climate-in-my-life).  



### Tutorials   
[Version control with GitHub and RStudio](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7GjEq0oE7-YrZoV5eWkO-YOQbZtz-RxX)  
[<img width="125" height="90" style="float:left; margin-right: 10px; margin-top: 4px" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/git_workflow.png">](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7GjEq0oE7-YrZoV5eWkO-YOQbZtz-RxX)A three-part youtube tutorial on a better way of keeping track of your files. Includes an overview of how git works, instructions for setting up git with RStudio, and a demonstration of how to use them together. This was originally a component of the University of New Hampshire course *Data Manipulation and Modelling in R*. All code and instructions are published on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sz-Tim/NR995_Module_9).  

[Introduction to Bayesian models in Stan]({{ site.url }}/assets/stan_intro.pdf)  
A very brief, practical introduction to Bayesian models, with some particularities of how the syntax and data structures in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org//) differ from those in [R](http://cran.r-project.org/). Slides only.
