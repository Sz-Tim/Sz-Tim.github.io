[COVID-19 Data Trends Explorer](https://sz-tim.shinyapps.io/covid19-ihme/)  
An interactive shiny app that allows you to explore the trends of the COVID-19 pandemic within or among countries and US states, and also to visually assess the accuracy of models predicting the outbreak. Developed as a more formal, user-friendly extension of my own personal morbid curiosity every morning. All code is published on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sz-Tim/COVID19-IHME).  


### Tutorials   

[Version control with GitHub and RStudio](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7GjEq0oE7-YrZoV5eWkO-YOQbZtz-RxX)  
A three-part youtube tutorial on a better way of keeping track of your files. Includes an overview of how git works, instructions for setting up git with RStudio, and a demonstration of how to use them together. Originally a component of the UNH course *Data Manipulation and Modelling in R*. All code and instructions are published on [GitHub](https://github.com/Sz-Tim/NR995_Module_9).  

[Introduction to Bayesian models in Stan]({{ site.url }}/assets/stan_intro.pdf)  
A very brief, practical introduction to Bayesian models, with some particularities of how the syntax and data structures in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org//) differ from those in [R](http://cran.r-project.org/). Slides only.
