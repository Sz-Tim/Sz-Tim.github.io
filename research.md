My research focuses on understanding the distribution of species and species diversity across spatial scales, motivated by a blend of intellectual interest in ecological theory and an underlying goal of empirically guided conservation and management efforts. My dissertation research evaluated biodiversity theory across spatial scales, capitalizing on modern tools and the accumulation of data across decades. Using datasets from the literature and extensive fieldwork in Colorado, I investigated ant communities along elevational gradients, seeking to understand the processes driving the patterns and changes at different spatial scales.  

My postdoctoral research at the University of New Hampshire focused on glossy buckthorn (*Frangula alnus*), a shrub native throughout Eurasia and invasive in the northeastern United States with particular associations with Eastern white pine (*Pinus strobus*). The landscape is predominately privately owned, making management decisions decentralized and complicated. The project aims to evaluate different management strategies and incentive structures by integrating a mechanistic model of glossy buckthorn population dynamics, the biological impacts of different management approaches, and economic decision models based on game theory. In a separate project, I am evaluating the impact of uncertainty and common data deficiencies on correlative and mechanistic species distribution models.  

My research at the University of Lausanne centers on ants and is a part of [Opération Fourmis](https://wp.unil.ch/fourmisvaud), a citizen science project hosted by the University of Lausanne, the Lausanne Museum of Natural History, and the Vaudoise Naturalist Society in honor of Auguste Forel (1848–1931), a myrmecologist from the region. Citizen scientists collected thousands of ants from around the canton while I concurrently led a scientifically structured sample. I'm using these data to assess the patterns of species diversity across spatial scales, and to test hypotheses about the environmental factors that shape species' traits.  

I am excited about the advances that modern technology and machine learning approaches make possible in ecology. Bayesian models allow us to incorporate multiple datasets at interacting spatial scales while accounting for sampling design and sources of uncertainty. With mechanistic simulations, we can generate and compare predictions in complex systems from different hypothesized processes and drivers. Modeling-based, quantitative approaches force us to be specific, precise, and explicit about our understanding of the biological world and the assumptions we make.
